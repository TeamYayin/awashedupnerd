# Who We Are and Why We Blog

We are like Moss and Roy from [The IT Crowd](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-it-crowd) show.
Unlike Moss and Roy who work in tech support, we are experienced Programmers, Full Stack Developers 
and Information Security researchers. One of our authors had to take IELTS test multiple times for his average writing skills.
In his IELTS learning blog, He reviews the resources that were helpful in improving writing skills and
other free learning series that guided him to score 8 and 9 bands in other three secttions.
We wish to play our part in increasing web presence of Aryan and Dravidan writers.
So we post helpful information to Aryan and Dravidian writers from 70's, 80's and 90's
who are new to web development and would like to host their stories and poems on personal websites.
